General steps:

- Add the custom domain to your site. Netlify will verify the domain name you enter and offer to sell the domain to you if it is available. If the domain is registered with an external registrar, you can assign it to your Netlify site.

- Configure your DNS provider to point the domain at the Netlify servers (if the domain registered through a third party). Domains registered during the custom domain flow do not require additional DNS configuration.

- Test that your site is accessible via the custom domain. There may be a delay while DNS changes propagate.
